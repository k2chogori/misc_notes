* GET /login HTTP/1.1
* GET - retrieve
* POST - receive data and do something with it
* PUT - make sure something is there
* REST API - way of thinking how webserver response to your query, it respones with resources
* We are asking for resources
* GET /item/chair 
* Objects (resources) hold the data
* REST is stateless - one request cannot depend on any other request; server knows about only about current request and doesn't know about previous requests
